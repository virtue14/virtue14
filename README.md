#### Hi! I'm PARK 👋🏻
I'm a backend developer who values well-structured and stable systems.  
I find meaning in small changes and enjoy growing steadily over time.

I'm always open to learning new technologies,  
and I feel the greatest sense of fulfillment when working with a team.

I strive to better understand how services flow and how they are structured,  
and I make a constant effort to think critically and keep learning.

I may move slowly, but I move forward consistently.
